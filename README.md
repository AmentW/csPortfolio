### Here are some of my webistes I made using HTML and CSS


***WebPage1** [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/dogPage/) *Source Code* [there](https://github.com/AmentW/testWeb/)
  * This webpage is called dogPage. It was my first crack at website coding, so it doesn't have very much HTML.
***WebPage2** [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/pagePage) *Source Code* [there](https://github.com/AmentW/testWeb/)
  * This webpage is called pagePage. I created a new webpage idea and added even more HTML.
***WebPage3** [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/finalPage) *Source Code* [there](https://github.com/AmentW/testWeb/)
  * This webpage is called finalPage. I made improvements to pagePage by adding some CSS styling to it.
