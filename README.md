### Here are some of my webistes I made using HTML and CSS


* WebPage1 [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/dogPage/) Source Code [there](https://github.com/AmentW/testWeb/)
  * This webpage is called dogPage. It was my first crack at website coding, so it doesn't have very much HTML.
* WebPage2 [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/pagePage) Source Code [there](https://github.com/AmentW/testWeb/)
  * This webpage is called pagePage. I created a new webpage idea and added even more HTML.
* WebPage3 [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/finalPage) Source Code [there](https://github.com/AmentW/testWeb/)
  * This webpage is called finalPage. I made improvements to pagePage by adding some CSS styling to it.
> While tinkering with the HTML and CSS I soon learned how tedious the formatting can become. None the less I recognize it's utility in web design with Javascript. I think a source of pride in this project was my CSS styling. In my project I used some CSS to edit my text and background with colors. I also used it to link different sections of my website.

### Here are some of the projects I made in Java using Processing
* Lightning [here](https://amentw.github.io/lightning2/Lightning/) Source Code [there](https://github.com/AmentW/lightning2)
> Lightning was a project that familiarized me with how animation works in Processing. The draw method used some basic x and y coordinates to write new line segments. I also used some if statements to create an invisible box that the lightning will show in. A source of pride in this project was undertsanding how the draw() method works. I learned that I have to pay close attention to when I draw the line so that it isn't layered behind the black background.

* Dice [here](https://amentw.github.io/dice3/Dice) Source Code [there](https://github.com/AmentW/lightning2)
> Dice didn't bring anything new the to table, but it did require some more planning. This lab had some opportunity to simplify code down to only far fewer lines within the show() method. This lab was pretty easy to complete once I figured out how each die needed to be drawn as. A source of pride for me in this project is my randC() method I wrote. It picks a random color within a range that creates a pastel-like color.
