# Welcome to my Computer Science Portfolio

### Here are some of my webistes I made using HTML and CSS. 

* WebPage1 [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/dogPage/)
  * This webpage is called dogPage. It was my first crack at website coding, so it doesn't have very much HTML.
* WebPage2 [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/pagePage)
  * This webpage is called pagePage. I created a new webpage idea and added even more HTML.
* WebPage3 [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/finalPage)
  * This webpage is called finalPage. I made improvements to pagePage by adding some CSS styling to it.
> While tinkering with the HTML and CSS I soon learned how tedious the formatting can become. None the less I recognize it's utility in web design with Javascript. I think a source of pride in this project was my CSS styling. In my project I used some CSS to edit my text and background with colors. I also used it to link different sections of my website.

Lightning [here](https://amentw.github.io/lightning2/Lightning/)
> Lightning was a project that familiarized me with how animation works in Processing. The draw method used some basic x and y coordinates to write new line segments. I also used some if statements to create an invisible box that the lightning will show in. A source of pride in this project was undertsanding how the draw() method works. I learned that I have to pay close attention to when I draw the line so that it isn't layered behind the black background.
