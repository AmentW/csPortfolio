# Welcome to my Computer Science Portfolio

### Here are some of my webistes I made using HTML and CSS. 
* WebPage1 [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/dogPage/)
  * This webpage is called dogPage. It was my first crack at website coding, so it doesn't have very much HTML.
* WebPage2 [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/pagePage)
  * This webpage is called pagePage. I created a new webpage idea and added even more HTML.
* WebPage3 [here](https://amentw.github.io/testWeb/finalPage)
  * This webpage is called finalPage. I made improvements to pagePage by adding some CSS styling to it.
